# MongoDB $inc Operator Type Error

This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, if the value provided is not a number (e.g., a string), MongoDB will throw an error.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage, and the `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version.
